Internship Detector 🕵️‍♂️

Find your next internship faster. 🚀 This app automatically scans job boards, filters listings based on your skills, and aggregates new opportunities in one place.

🌟 What It Does

Tired of manually checking a dozen different websites for new internship postings every day? Internship Detector automates this entire process.

This tool is built to:

Scrape multiple job boards and career pages (like LinkedIn, Indeed, company-specific sites, etc.).

Filter the results based on your predefined criteria (e.g., "Software Engineer Intern", "Marketing Intern", "Remote").

Notify you of new postings that match your search.

Aggregate all relevant listings into a single, clean dashboard.

Stop searching, start applying! 💼

✨ Key Features

Multi-Source Scraping: Pulls data from various popular job platforms.

Smart Filtering: Filter by keyword, location, company, full-time/part-time, and more.

Email/Push Notifications: Get real-time alerts when a new, matching internship is posted. (Note: Add if this is a planned/existing feature)

Dashboard View: See all your potential internships in one organized interface.

Duplicate Removal: Intelligently identifies and removes duplicate postings from different sources.

🛠️ How It Works (Technology Stack)

This project is built with:

Backend: [e.g., Python (Scrapy/BeautifulSoup), Node.js (Puppeteer/Cheerio)]

Database: [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, Firestore]

Frontend: [e.g., React, Vue, Svelte, or simple HTML/CSS/JS]

Notifications: [e.g., SendGrid, Twilio, or a custom email script]

The core logic involves scheduled scraping jobs that parse the HTML of target sites, extract job details, store them in the database, and then compare them against user-defined filters to send alerts.
